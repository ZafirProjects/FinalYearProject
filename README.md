# FinalYearProject
 
This project builds upon the research done by [Meidan et. Al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03409.pdf) and uses the N-BaloT dataset which they created from their experiments. The title of this project is 'Exploring the effectiveness of transfer learning on autoencoders for botnet attack detection.' This project tries to answer whether or not a Machine Learning technique called Trasfer Learning is useful for the development of IoT intrusion detection systems, specifically for botnet attacks.

The submission branch of this repository uses a subset of the N-BaloT dataset. It is also the brach that has the most development done on it and so should be the branch used when running this project.
